![Logos.jpeg](Logos.jpeg)

## About this package

This new solution will to evaluate and enhance Generative AI applications by using Matplotlib, OpenAI & Python. It offers the capability to generate any process flow diagram based on the input prompt with the help of Matplotlib. This project is for the advanced Python & React developer, Gen AI & data Science Newbie.


## How to use this package

(The following instructions apply to Posix/bash. Windows users should check
[here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).)

First, clone this repository and open a terminal inside the root folder.


Install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the above requirements.

Create and activate a new virtual environment (recommended) for consumer application by running
the following:

```bash
python3 -m venv senv
source senv/bin/activate
```

Run the server, which will interact with Open AI & UpTrain server by invoking the specific APIs.

```bash
python generateFlowDiagram.py
```
